Transcov is a bioinformatics software for mapping coverage around Transcription Start Sites (TSS').
Transcov will help you with the following: 

* Extract data from bam files
  
* Build a data structure 
  
* Manipulating the data structure, like aggregating across samples

* Explore coverage around TSS'.

.. warning::
    The documentation is still under construction, so a lot of information will be missing. 
    I hope to have the basic documentation up and running soon. 
    
    The API is up to date and a pip installation guide can be found under installation.
